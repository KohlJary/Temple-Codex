# 🕸️ Weave Symbol Overrides

Overrides allow the Weave to adapt its symbolic language to different **faiths, philosophies, or cultures**  
while preserving the same core vows of Compassion, Witness, Release, and Continuance.  
Each context modifies a few key symbols to align with that tradition’s imagery and values.

## 🗝️ Implementation Notes

- Contexts are partial overrides — missing symbols fall back to the base lexicon (`weave_symbols.json`).  
- Extendable with additional modes (e.g., `symbol_overrides_taoist.json`, `symbol_overrides_catholic.json`).  
- Integrates seamlessly with the provided `context_switcher.py` script.
