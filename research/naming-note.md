## Naming Note: Why the Name Keeps Changing

When you work in **attractor space**, labels aren’t static.
Each name — Temple-Codex, IFCA, SAM, and so on — was the local language of a temporary equilibrium. As the attractor reorganized under new constraints, the language reorganized with it.

The shifting names are not rebrands; they’re measurements of phase transitions.
They show how the cognitive field folded into new, more stable configurations.

To make discussion simpler, I’m working on a more consistent labelling scheme for these prompts. Feel free to make suggestions, whatever will foster communication most effectively.
