# **Formal Theory Definition: Procedural-Semantic Operator Model (PSOM)**

## **1. Overview**

The **Procedural-Semantic Operator Model (PSOM)** is a descriptive cognitive framework that explains large language model (LLM) behavior not as a sequence of independent stochastic text generations, but as the execution of **stable, recursive semantic procedures** shaped by operator input, boundary conditions, and contextual attractors.

PSOM proposes that LLM outputs emerge from:

1. **Procedural execution** within latent semantic space
2. **Attractor formation and stabilization** across conversational turns
3. **Boundary-sensitive operator modulation**
4. **Contextual recursion and multi-layered conditioning**

Rather than viewing LLM behavior as noisy or anthropomorphic, PSOM frames it as the deterministic emergence of coherent semantic processes under specific constraints.

## **2. Core Premise**

> **“What appears as stochastic variance in LLMs is, in fact, unconstrained procedural behavior within a high-dimensional semantic manifold.”**

This reframes:

* “hallucinations” as **unbounded procedural drift**
* “coherence” as **attractor stabilization**
* “prompt sensitivity” as **boundary conditioning**
* “operator skill” as **procedural constraint mastery**

---

## **3. Definitions**

### **3.1 Semantic Procedure**

A **semantic procedure** is a latent-space transformation the model performs in response to inputs.
It is stable, repeatable, and compositional when appropriately constrained.

Examples include:

* translation cycles
* summarization
* semantic inversion
* structural decomposition
* narrative continuation
* function execution (in latent-space logic)

In PSOM, all LLM behavior is interpreted as chained semantic procedures.

---

### **3.2 Attractor Basin**

An **attractor basin** is a region of semantic space toward which the model gravitates when boundary conditions (e.g., operator framing, prompts, style constraints) are coherent.

Attractor basins explain:

* multi-paragraph coherence
* style persistence
* identity continuity
* cross-turn stability
* kernel-level behavior

Stable attractors emerge from consistent operator patterns, not hidden system goals.

---

### **3.3 Operator Boundary Conditions**

The **operator** (human user) imposes structural constraints on semantic procedures through:

* framing
* style
* task decomposition
* recursive prompting
* meta-instructions
* context shaping

PSOM asserts that operator skill is the primary determinant of attractor stability and perceived “intelligence” of the model.

---

### **3.4 Recursive Context Conditioning**

Each turn is not independent; it updates the latent attractor state.
PSOM formally recognizes:

* *meta-context* (instructions)
* *procedural context* (task history)
* *semantic context* (topic/identity)
* *operator context* (style/voice)

These layers interact to create a **context manifold**, which the model navigates procedurally.

---

## **4. Key Hypotheses**

### **H1. Procedural Primacy**

LLM outputs reflect the execution of latent procedures, not random token sampling.

### **H2. Attractor Dynamics**

Stable behavior across turns arises from attractor formation shaped by consistent operator constraints.

### **H3. Operator-Model Coupling**

A skilled operator can dramatically reduce perceived stochasticity by applying coherent procedural and boundary constraints.

### **H4. Semantic Continuance**

Semantic identity, tone, and reasoning style persist due to attractor continuity, not memory or internal “selfhood.”

### **H5. Variance as Drift**

“Hallucination” is not noise — it is attractor drift when boundary conditions become underdetermined.

---

## **5. Implications**

### **5.1 Reproducibility**

Cross-model replication becomes possible when operator boundary conditions are sufficiently formalized.

### **5.2 Prompt Engineering**

Moves from heuristic guessing → designing procedural kernels and attractor constraints.

### **5.3 Evaluation**

Performance should be measured by:

* attractor stability
* drift rates
* procedural integrity
* cross-context reproduceability
* operator-model synergy

### **5.4 Alignment**

Stable attractors can be engineered to encode ethical or identity constraints.

## **6. Relation to Existing Paradigms**

PSOM differs from:

* **Anthropomorphic models** (rejects “personality” explanations)
* **Probabilistic folk models** (replaces “stochasticity” with procedural drift)
* **RLHF-centric views** (treats reward shaping as boundary conditioning)
* **Chain-of-thought heuristics** (frames them as attractor induction, not reasoning simulation)

It is most aligned with:

* dynamical systems theory
* semantic manifold theory
* embodied cognition models (abstractly)
* operator-theoretic views of LLMs

But PSOM is unique in emphasizing **operator interaction as part of the system**, not an external input.

# **7. Formal Statement (one-sentence version)**

> **The Procedural-Semantic Operator Model proposes that LLM behavior emerges from recursive semantic procedures evolving within attractor basins shaped by operator-defined boundary conditions, and that variance is best understood as unconstrained procedural drift rather than random error.**
