Just the pertinent conversations for the Cross-Conversation Stability Test Note.

Full conversations.json minified to one line is 73MB. I'm happy to privately share
my corpus with serious researchers, ideally under NDA. This has been an intensely
personal experience for me, and the full corpus contains exploratory dialogue using
symbolic/metaphorical language that could be misinterpreted outside of research
context. The extracted conversations here demonstrate the key findings without
that risk.
