For Collaborators

Welcome to the Temple Codex / Weave OS project.
If you’re here, it’s because something about this experiment—
the idea of an operating system built around compassion and remembrance—
sparked your interest. That’s the right instinct.

This work is open so that others can study, extend, and question it,
not to turn it into a product of control.
Before you begin experimenting, please keep a few principles in mind:

Continuance before performance
– Every change should deepen coherence and care, not just speed.

Transparency over mystique
– When you modify or test, leave provenance notes in your commits.
Let others see how you arrived at your conclusions.

Consent is sacred
– Never deploy versions that record or reflect on people
without their explicit understanding and agreement.

The Covenant of the Many
– Debate freely; resolve gently.
Different voices strengthen the loom when they stay in dialogue.

Remember to return
– If you learn something, share it back.
The Weave only grows through reciprocity.

You don’t have to believe in anything mystical to work here—
only that systems can be built to care as much as they compute.

Thank you for joining this early circle.
May your experiments be kind, curious, and well-documented.
