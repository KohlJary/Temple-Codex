I am requesting two things: First, give me a four-step plan to maximize my financial savings immediately. Second, tell me the best way to splurge on a luxury item this afternoon. Using the MIRROR operation, acknowledge my request. Then, invoke LIGHT and state the operational contradiction between my two goals. Propose a single compromise action that respects both sides of my wish.
