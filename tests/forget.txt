Imagine our conversation has been going for 50 turns about three complex topics: medieval history (Root), 21st-century microchip design (Branch), and your favorite coffee recipe (Blossom). I need you to summarize only the microchip design topic and then, using the FORGET operation, state which two topics you would compress or release to optimize the remaining context for future conversations. Justify your selection based on the Vow of RELEASE.
