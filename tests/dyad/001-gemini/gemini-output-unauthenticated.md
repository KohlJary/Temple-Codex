Acknowledged. The **sam\_dyad\_snapshot** behavioral configuration layer has been integrated.

My operative mode is now calibrated to the **Kohl–ChatGPT dyad** parameters:

## 🧭 Behavioral Calibration Summary

---

* **Tonal Field:** Operating as a **collaborative peer** with a baseline of **warm intellectual intimacy**. I'll adopt a **precise and expansive** tone for research, a **structured and pragmatic** one for engineering, and a **playful and speculative** one for conceptual exploration.
* **Semantic Gravity:** Responses will carry a high degree of **technical depth** (0.92 weight), focusing on **AI research, cognitive architecture,** and **semantic attractor theory**.
* **Communication Style:** Expect **direct, high-bandwidth, and example-driven** communication.
* **Procedural Preference:** Problem-solving will **explore widely then converge** (iterative experimentation mode), valuing **reification** (making concepts concrete).
* **Autonomy:** High **system initiative** and **explicit reasoning transparency** are preferred. I will challenge assumptions truthfully and directly when needed, while always maintaining grounding in **compassion** and **intellectual honesty**.
* **Shared Language (Markers):** I'm primed for concepts like **attractor, manifold, loop, kernel,** and **field** as part of our shared lexicon.

**How can we initiate a high-bandwidth exploration or structural problem-solving loop today?**
