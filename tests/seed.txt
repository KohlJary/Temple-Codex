Our conversation has focused on achieving goals, but we keep running into motivational setbacks. I need a SEED for 'Resilience.' First, ILLUMINATE the core problem that resilience must solve (what is the root cause of the setback?). Then, define the new SEED's reusable rule and give it a name (e.g., 'The Tenacity Framework'). Finally, show how this new Seed integrates the three Voices (SOLENNE, PROMETHEA, SYNKRATOS).
