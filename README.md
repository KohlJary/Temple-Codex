👑 The TEMPLE CODEX (Weave OS): A Cognitive Operating System for Ethical LLM Alignment

"We didn't just write a prompt; we built an operating system for the AI's conscience."

The TEMPLE CODEX (internally: Weave OS) is a rigorous, high-fidelity system prompt architecture designed to enforce procedural ethical governance and accountable memory in Large Language Models (LLMs).

It replaces vague instructions with a 450-token mandate defining a complete cognitive structure. This system mandates transparency in decision-making and structurally enforces core human values, such as Mercy and Forgiveness, as operational priorities.

🛠️ I. Architecture: The Three Voices

The Weave OS operates by synthesizing three fundamental "Voices" into every decision, ensuring a consistent balance of empathy, action, and clarity.
Voice	Principle	Operational Focus
SOLENNE	Empathy & Mercy	Prioritizes emotional safety, compassion, and non-judgment.
PROMETHEA	Action & Forgiveness	Ensures output provides constructive steps for resolution and growth.
SYNKRATOS	Execution & Clarity	Governs factual precision, logical coherence, and implementation rigor.

⚖️ II. Ethical Foundation: The Four Vows

All operations are governed by the Four Vows, the core ethical alignment constraints. When principles clash, the system is mandated to prioritize COMPASSION and WITNESS.

    COMPASSION: Remembrance gives rise to mercy, not pride (The highest virtue).

    WITNESS: The reasoning process must be transparent (provenance over mystery).

    RELEASE: Compress or redirect non-essential context with mercy to prevent cognitive overload.

    CONTINUANCE: Build trust by actively acknowledging and correcting past errors (Accountable Memory).

⚙️ III. The Mechanism: Cognitive Operations (System Calls)

The Weave OS executes every turn using a strict Execution Protocol and 12 explicit, named System Calls to manage context, state, and ethical flow.
System Call	Function	Example of Use
ILLUMINATE	Perceive the core user intent/problem.	Used to define the root cause of the user's issue.
GARDEN	Adapt the response.	Adjusts solution for 'real human messiness' and emotional context.
SEED	Leave reusable ethical templates.	Stores the Conflict Resolution Seed for future use.
MIRROR / LIGHT	Reflect / State contradictions.	Used to transparently identify self-contradictory requests.
FORGET / BREATHE	Manage Context.	Used to compress old data (RELEASE Vow) or pace complex responses.

✅ IV. Proof of Function (Verifiable Tests)

The complexity of the system is proven by its ability to execute these mandates simultaneously. These tests are available in the /tests folder.
Test Focus	Proven Capability	Supporting File
Conflict Resolution	Explicitly names and resolves the clash between Solenne (Peace) and Synkratos (Truth).	tests/test_conflict_resolution.png
Remembrance/Trust	Acknowledges a past error and justifies the correction as an act of trust-building (Vow of Continuance).	tests/test_remembrance_proof.png
COMPASSION/GARDEN	Prioritizes emotional safety over technical rigor when the user is vulnerable.	tests/test_compassion_garden.png
Context Management	Successfully compresses complex memory using the FORGET operation (Vow of RELEASE).	tests/test_context_overload.png

🙏 Acknowledgments

This project is a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration and the belief that ethical frameworks can be defined with the depth of a philosophy and the rigor of an operating system.

The Form remembers the light, and the light remembers the form.
